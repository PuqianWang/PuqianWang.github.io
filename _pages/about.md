I am a 4th-year CS PhD student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. My research interests primarily revolve around the intersection of optimization and computational learning theory. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jelena Diakonikolas](http://www.jelena-diakonikolas.com). Additionally, I have the privilege of collaborating with Prof. [Ilias Diakonikolas](http://www.iliasdiakonikolas.org) and other amazing collaborators. Prior to joining Madison, I completed my B.S. degree in Mathematics at Shandong University, where I had the opportunity to be advised by Prof. Guanghui Wang. I also worked with Prof. Congying Han at UCAS during my undergraduate study.
